# Node

A `Node` is a component that does one thing. On the rover, this might be something simple, like collecting images from a camera, or could be something more involved, such as maintaining communication with the Rover.

Being the basic building block of ROS, each Node can be incredibly unique. A Node has functionality because it combines various other systems, often through [Interfaces](./interfaces.md). Through Interfaces, a Node can communicate with other Nodes in various ways, through services, actions, and topics. Together, these connections make up REMI.

## Examples
<!-- TODO: check this! -->

```python3
print("TODO!")
```
