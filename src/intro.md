# Introduction

ROS 2, or the Robot Operating System, is a framework allowing you to define your robot by each component it's made up of, message it sends, and action it takes.

For the Sooner Rover Team, ROS allows us to easily subsection the Rover, who we call REMI, into components. Each component can be defined in terms of ROS [Nodes](./nodes.md). These Nodes can individually be poked, changed, debugged, and tested.

## Why this book?

This book is a guide describing all the important parts of ROS for Rover development. It's a simpler version of the official documentation, with Rover-specific examples and more relevant information.

Here's the table of contents:

- Node
- Interfaces
- TODO
<!-- TODO: Add a integration for the Messages description, perhaps as part of introduction (here) or as another "building block" the way we did with Nodes. Bottom line is that we want to define Messages as a data structure used by Interfaces for communication -->
